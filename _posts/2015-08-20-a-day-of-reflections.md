title: A Day of Reflections
---

Now as week 3 of pre-course is coming to a close, I sometimes find myself reflecting on my tasks ahead.

I wonder why have I not taken this route earlier, why have I seemly wasted so much of my youth.  And now, finally on the right paths, I feel so very behind.  It seems many years ago now, so many lost opportunities, I wonder if I can ever catch up enough, do well enough to really succeed in my own way, and realise my dream.  People often say that you are at your most creative in your 20s, well I am now past it, and there is nothing I can do to buy that back.  At times I feel my memory is not as it was, my cognition is not as swift as my younger self, and I have yet so much further to go.  All these doubts have been plaguing my mind as sometimes I get a few moments to myself.  

Then again, there is but one choice, to keep up, to keep believing that one can still make it, with hardwork, determination and an iron belief I can still realise my dream.  We all live once, and no amount of regrets can change any of those choices which our wiser older self would have made differently.  In the end, I can now console myself to be content with my trying and knowing many years from now, at least I will be happy that by the time I realised, I still gave it all, no matter how difficult, late and demanding is the task ahead...
