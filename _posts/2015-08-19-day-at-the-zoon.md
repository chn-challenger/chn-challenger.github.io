title: Family Day At The Zoo
---

As I get ready for the hectic main course at Maker's Academy in September, I thought it will be great spend some more family time while we can!  So, today I took the family to my one of my favourite places - the zoo!  I love zoos and animals, and I want to share my love with my son.  There are better zoos than the London zoo, Berlin zoo is the best I have been to, but anyway, London zoo is our closest, so London zoo it is!

Driving from south London to Regents park while avoiding congestion zone was better than expected, and we really had a wonderful day, Matthew enjoyed himself a lot!

We didn't get to see everything, because Matthew knocked himself out been so tired, but it's ok, we didn't need to see it all!  

Now as evening sets in, it's back to ruby...
