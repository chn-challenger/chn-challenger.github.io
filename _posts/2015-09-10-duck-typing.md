title: Duck-typing by Joe Zhou and Catherine Stevenson
---

In essence, ruby is a language where in methods it does not care what _type_ of argument is entered into a method/function.  It only cares that the fed object has/can respond to the called methods or interfaces within the method. This behaviour of the ruby language is known as *Duck-typing* or as put another way: A duck is defined not by its type, but by it’s duck-like behaviour, which is the set of methods a ‘duck’ can respond to.  Nothing better than making a whacky example…
