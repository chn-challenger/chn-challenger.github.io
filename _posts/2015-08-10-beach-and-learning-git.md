title: Sunday at the beech and Monday of Git
---

Took my family to the beach at Botany bay on Sunday.  What a lovely day, hot enough but not too hot and not windy, although the beach was busy as expected!  It turns out my son loves the beach very much, he was so busy and keen to play with sand and puddle in water he didn't even eat much food, and appears to have forgotten his afternoon nap!

Today (Monday), I figured best to sit down and so some serious work on this week's topic of Git.  A few weeks back while I was learning various things by myself, one thing I really never understood was how to use Github.  Back then I was trying to understand Github in detail without understanding Git or know how to use the commandline - no wonder I struggled.  Managed to finish all the compulsory work: Intro, Git Immersion and VC exercises.  Tomorrow planning on doing some the optional work to reinforce the concepts and maybe do a kata on Codewars.
