Last a few days was spent in the twilight zone, I did actually work pretty hard on ruby, let's try to keep that up.  Saturday was a working day, no choice, still have to earn bread to fee myself. :)  Not too bad however, everyone has to resolve the issue of living, eating and making a few bobs to keep things ticking along!

We had a choice of doing Chris Pine chpt9 - 14 or Ruby Kickstart sessions1 & 2.  Having done a lot of Chris Pine before pre-course, I thought I get those submitted first.  Well...it didn't all work at first, actually most of it didn't pass rspec first time.  I find I often mismatch by a little bit, or maybe an odd case that has not been accounted for.  Some of the exercises were challenging such as translating to english numbers.  There were some that was I thought not clearly explained such as the orange tree exercise.  We were supposed to create an Orangetree class, and define some methods on it.  The instructions does not say with each year pass a tree is meant to grow by 0.6, it just says grow a bit each year.  So really without peeping into the answers, I would have had no idea.  Also, picking fruit, I initially wrote a method to allow trying to pick *n* number of fruits, but something more specific was required in order to pass rspec.  Suffice to say I honestly did not enjoy that exercise as it was not well described, without looking at the solution, I don't see how I could have got there.  Overall, in Chris Pine's book, there were some good exercises, but it is definitely more pain than Ruby Kickstart.

So as I immerged myself Ruby, after CP's book, I also did ruby-kickstart, finished sessions 1 and 2 exercises, without reading the notes or examples admittedly, although I do plan to read them now.  Only to realize I forked the wrong ruby-kickstart, I forked JoshCreek's original, where as I was supposed to fork the updated one from Maker's.  So I had to fork again and copy over my work, there is one thing however that I did notice a _secret_: JoshCreek's original contained more cheatsheets which the Maker's one removed...haha...so it's not bad to stumble on it afterall!  Ruby-kickstart exercises were much better explained and precise, I enjoyed them more than CP's, and yes it took a great deal less time to complete.  Although now I have moved onto session3, and challenge 5 is a right killer!  I happened to stumble on a kyu4 kata on Codewars that was more or less the same as challenge 5.  So in the end, it took me embarrasingly longer than the 30 mins recommended to complete the challenge and also the Codewars kata.  Maker's solution with recursion was neat.  However after completing the Codewars kata, I saw some amazing one-liners, that's right literally one line, and I wrote more than 30 after many attempts... Anyway, no poin feeling sorry for myself, the right thing to do was to learn and understand that one liner, definitely took longer than a minute to learn!  Learning from improved solutions to problems seems very good way to learn for me.  I don't always want to read and understand other solutions because...its hard!  But its good for me for sure.  You know Chinese have a saying:  'Expect good medicine is bitter', Amen that, that is wisdom for ya!

Last but not least, met my mentor today and had a nice pairing session, I think I now get the structure of the pairing session.  Looking forward to do some more!
