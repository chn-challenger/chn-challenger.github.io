I am a lifetime maths enthuiast and mathematics graduate of Imperial College (1st class honors).  Having worked some years in a finance firm as a risk analyst, I moved onto full time tutoring as my discovered my passion is in teaching.  My plan now is to work on my own comprehensive maths educational website, for which I have decided to learn coding at Maker's Academy in London.

### Other information

I live in London with my wife and my lovely one year old son.  My favourite hobby is taking my family out on day trips.  In my increasingly diminishing spare time, I enjoy playing computer games.  O, and I still love legos!
